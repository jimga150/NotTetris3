For all shapes that aren't the walls:
For all shapes in body:
Ray cast the top and bottom rows from both sides to the shape

cut = false

IF top hits:
	Get list of shape vertices that are ABOVE the top line
	combine list with the two points where the ray cast hit
	!!! new body with shape with those points
	cut = true
 
IF bottom hits:
	Get list of shape vertices that are BELOW the bottom line
	combine list with the two points where the ray cast hit
	!!! new body with shape with those points
	cut = true

IF cut OR body center lies between rays:
	delete the original shape

(figure out how to determine when two shapes on the same side of a cut should be part of the same body)



Volume of the line:

for each shape besides walls:

Ray cast the top and bottom rows from both sides to the shape

IF top hits OR if bottom hits
	Get list of shape vertices that are BETWEEN the two lines
	Combine with list of ray vast vertices from both sides
	Make shape with those vertices
	Calculate volume of the shape 
	(you can throw away this shape)
	add volume to total

ELSE
	see if first vertex of shape is inside the lines
	IF it is:
		add volume of shape to total
