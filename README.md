# NotTetris3
Not Tetris 3. Now in C++ rather than the much slower Lua

Known bugs:
* occasional value jumps on row density
* score sometimes is off by one from the original game
* tetris pieces not always flush with wall (one pixel off depending on scaling)

Todo:
* keep optimizing for many shapes
* Add gamemode B
* Add multiplayer
