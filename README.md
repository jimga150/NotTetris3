# NotTetris3
Not Tetris 3. Now in C++ rather than the much slower Lua

Known bugs:
--shapes sometimes begin intersecting and floating through each other
--sometimes line clear doesnt detect/cut most shapes within the line
--occasional value jumps on row density

Todo:
--optimize for many shapes (moooore)
